Saw my accountant I can take a draw but it has to be at cost basis which was what COCOMO II and david a wheeler's cost estimate was about I have to get it it to work with C++,  and C# and to take the draw or payroll it does have to be taxed. and it would be a capital gain at that point. intangibles aren't taxed.
